Other relevant global geospatial datasets for SDGs
====================================================

Global HRLC data are also used in combination with complementary global geospatial information demonstrating their capabilities of directly supporting the computation of indicators e.g. from SDG 2 [#f0]_, 6 [#f1]_, and 9 [#f2]_. 

Actually, land cover is only one of the `Global Fundamental Geospatial Data Themes <https://ggim.un.org/documents/Fundamental%20Data%20Publication.pdf>`_ to SDGs identified by the United Nations. These Fundamental Themes include a variety of geospatial datasets which are necessary to spatially represent key phenomena and objects for the realization of economic, social, and environmental targets identified by the SDGs. These datasets include - among others - demography, soil/vegetation parameters, administrative boundaries, infrastructures, transport networks, 2D/3D topographic maps, water bodies, etc. 

The suitability (fit-for-purpose) of `complementary global geospatial datasets <https://ggim.un.org/documents/Report_Global_and_Complementary_Geospatial_Data_for_SDGs.pdf>`_ is difficult to assess globally for each specific SDG indicator or country. Spatial and temporal resolutions, thematic details and accuracies should be evaluated case-by-case, using recommendations valid also for the global HRLC data, and their use should be functional to the provision of baseline data in support of national SDGs reporting.

:numref:`2.2.1` contains information on popular global open geospatial datasets which might be employed in combination with global HRLC data for the computation of land cover-connected SDG indicators.
